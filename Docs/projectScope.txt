Project Scope: Trip Cost Tracking Application
Core Purpose:
A web application for tracking and calculating travel costs based on fuel consumption, helping users manage and monitor their transportation expenses.

Main Features:
1. Dashboard (Main Page)
Trip Management: Users can add, edit, and delete trips
Trip Cards Display: Shows all saved trips in a grid layout with:
Trip name (e.g., "Work Commute", "Weekend Shopping")
Distance per trip (in km)
Frequency (trips per month)
Calculated monthly cost
Add New Trip Modal: Form to create new trips with validation
2. Cost Calculation System
Automatic Calculation: Calculate cost per kilometer based on:
Cost to fill up the car
Distance before fill-up
Distance after fill-up
Formula: Cost per km = Fill-up cost / (Distance after - Distance before)
Manual Override: Users can manually set their cost per km if they already know it
Persistent Storage: Saves the cost per km value using localStorage
3. Key Data Points Tracked:
Cost per kilometer (displayed in sidebar)
Individual trips with name, distance, and frequency
Monthly cost calculations for each trip
Total fuel efficiency based on actual fill-up data
4. User Interface:
Responsive design with a modern gradient background
Sidebar navigation with current cost per km display
Modal-based forms for adding/editing trips
Tab-based interface for different calculation methods
Card-based layout for trip display
Technical Stack (from mock-up):
Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
LocalStorage for data persistence
Inter font from Google Fonts
Responsive grid layouts
Modern CSS with gradients and backdrop filters
Target Use Cases:
Commuters tracking daily work travel costs
Business travelers calculating expense reports
Budget-conscious individuals monitoring fuel expenses
Fleet managers tracking multiple vehicle routes
The application is essentially a personal fuel cost tracker that helps users understand their transportation expenses by combining actual fuel costs with travel patterns. It's particularly useful for people who want to budget for fuel costs or track the financial impact of their regular trips.

Would you like me to help you plan how to implement this in your Angular project?
